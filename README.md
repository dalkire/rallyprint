Print subset of tickets on Rally's Print Story and Defect Cards page.

This is a simple Chrome extension for use in Rally (https://rally1.rallydev.com).

On the Print Story and Defect Cards page select a subset of tickets you would like to print. After making your selection, click the filter link to the right of the Print Story Cards button and the tickets that were not selected will disappear. Now when you click the Print Story Cards button, it will only print the ones you selected.
